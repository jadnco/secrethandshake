## Local Development

The following assumes you are on a Mac and you have `ruby` and the `sass` gem installed.

First, run SASS: 

    sass --watch ./css --style compressed -r ./css/_lib/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb

And then run the server:

    ruby server.rb

You can then view the website at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser of choice.

Good luck!
